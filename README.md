# Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

This repository contains my approach to the labs and assignments for the topic of Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. In this seminar, we explore how deep learning neural network models have revolutionized natural language processing and changed the way we interact with machines, enabling applications like Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Skype translator, Google Translate, and more. These models have the capability to infer continuous representations for words and sentences, eliminating the need for hand-engineered features present in traditional machine learning approaches.

## Syllabus

The seminar covers the following topics:

1. Introduction to Machine Learning and NLP with Tensorflow
2. Multilayer Perceptron
3. Word Embeddings and Recurrent Neural Networks
4. Seq2seq, Neural Machine Translation, and Improved RNNs
5. Attention Mechanisms, Neural Machine Translation, and Natural Language Inference
6. Transfer Learning
7. Bridging the Gap between Natural Languages and the Visual World
8. Convolutional Neural Networks for Text
